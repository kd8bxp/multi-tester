# Multi-Tester

## Installation

## Things To Do

## Usage

Use the UNO to test Resistors, capacitance test, and diode tester 
based largely on "The Companion IC" by Srijal97
http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Companion-IC/
(Differences - I used a Arduino Uno, and a I2C OLED, no RTC, also combined his code to one ino file, with some slight modifications to work like that)
On the whole however this is Srijal97's code.
